Libraries are often distributed as a ZIP file or folder. The name of the folder is the name of the library. 
Inside the folder will be a .cpp file, a .h file and often a keywords.txt file, examples folder, and other files required by the library.
Starting with version 1.0.5, you can install 3rd party libraries in the IDE.
Do not unzip the downloaded library, leave it as is.
In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library''.
